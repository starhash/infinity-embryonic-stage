# infinity-embryonic-stage (June-August 2015)
A computational framework based on Tuples and other constructs revolving around the same concept, targeted at providing a flexible, re-programmable platform for modern day computation involved in Artificial Intelligence, Neural Networks, Data Mining and many major fields of study in Computer Science.

## The platform model has been presented as a research poster at Manipal University Research Colloqium's Student Research Poster Competition.
