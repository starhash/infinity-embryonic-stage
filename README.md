# infinity-embryonic-stage (June-August 2015)
A computational framework based on Tuples and other constructs revolving around the same concept, targeted at providing a flexible, re-programmable platform for modern day computation involved in Artificial Intelligence, Neural Networks, Data Mining and many major fields of study in Computer Science.

*This version will no longer be updated. This release is unstable and bugged. The author does not guarantee any mishap from execution of this code under any environment. Please note that this release is only a partial model, made available for the public to ponder over its shortcomings/flaws and suggesting modifications.*

### The platform model has been presented as a research poster at Manipal University Research Colloqium's Student Research Poster Competition.
